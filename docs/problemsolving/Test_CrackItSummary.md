## Chapter 1: The Most Important Skill You Never Learned[ >>](marginnote3app://note/358BDEDC-5647-4C38-B98C-E1021005AFBF)

### 1. **Fast and Slow Problem Solving[ >>](marginnote3app://note/CA94F99E-F82A-4A3D-BEFC-22111F2BE03D)**
#### Chúng ta thường có xu hướng đưa ra giải pháp nhanh chóng và đơn giản hóa 1 vấn đề phức tạp khi chưa hiểu rõ, nhưng lại có niềm tin sai lệch rằng chúng ta đã biết mọi thứ đủ rõ để giải quyết đc vấn đề[ >>](marginnote3app://note/410A8E47-C3BE-43F2-9488-82E84730C940)

* At the time of Kelvin Rollins’s anointing as Dell’s CEO, Dell was the world’s largest and most profitable producer of computers. Only two and a half years later, at the beginning of 2007, the situation was very different[ >>](marginnote3app://note/67E02AB9-2B1F-4696-871B-0D045DF55F92)
* The problem Dell faced in early 2007 involved a complex set of poorly understood factors, which made it hard to define the problem, let alone know how to solve it.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/AC9C6B3A-F72A-4900-8553-173E27607BDC)
* Such complex and ill-defined problems are idiosyncratic and infrequently occur, making it difficult to develop routine solutions or approaches to solving them[ >>](marginnote3app://note/8A8D20AF-9F15-436A-AFCB-D49FD946DA54)

#### Daniel Kahneman, psychologist and Nobel laureate in economics, explains in his groundbreaking best seller Thinking, Fast and Slow how we have two minds in one brain[ >>](marginnote3app://note/CA76AB97-FFCE-460D-8308-BD69AD751F9B)

* System 1: Our default approach to thinking,  largely involuntary, automatic, and unconscious, —including about how to solve problems—is fast. When thinking fast, we limit our attention to information readily available rather than search for information that could help us better understand the situation, a tendency Kahneman calls “What You See Is All There Is (WYSIATI).”[ >>](marginnote3app://note/08CC348D-6203-47C6-AE78-7D1AAC67E8CC)
* System 2: Slow thinking (aka “System 2”) is voluntary because it requires effortful attention and conscious deliberation. But this effort is cognitively expensive: mental capacity is a scarce resource, and we need to allocate it to the problem (thus the phrase “paying attention”). Consequently, in solving challenging problems, we often gravitate toward the law of least effort. One way we do this is to rely on the results of the faster and cognitively cheaper System 1 approach to thinking. Our deliberative System 2 thinking then merely endorses System 1’s proposals.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/B059419E-CCB6-440C-9B25-BEE15C255137)
    * With sufficient effort and skill, however, slow thinking can be logical, skeptical, and methodical, causing us to search for missing information, question assumptions and beliefs, and utilize tools and frameworks to make sense of a situation, resulting in a much better understanding of it and how to tackle it[ >>](marginnote3app://note/46188D5F-8C95-4205-9B17-FCA13A029358)
    * The temptation in the story about Kevin Rollins and Dell Inc. is to think (too) fast about the problem and solution or to be lazy in our slow, deliberative thinking.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/FA133905-D6BA-40C5-AC09-C32417C7A90C)
    * it’s easy for us to take it at face value and believe we don’t need to know more. Immediately, our brains go to work on detecting the associations among the information.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/CEE76601-A292-4560-8F36-6E81A0B3DCFD)
    * But would we come to the same conclusion if we questioned the information and searched for more?[ >>](marginnote3app://note/F70143F2-DF8C-4DEC-9840-02832E910160)
    * When we stop presuming we know what’s going on, and instead question the sufficiency of the information we possess and search for more, we become more likely to overcome our assumptions and see the problem differently, enabling us to generate different and potentially better solutions[ >>](marginnote3app://note/C2A3EAF8-C5BD-4442-98FB-C0B2597763F6)
* Therein lies the core problem of problem solving—our tendency to think too fast (or too lazy) and jump to solutions. We spend too little time and effort understanding a problem, believing instead we know all we need. We unleash the associational machine in our minds, reflecting our implicit assumptions about causes and effects, on this limited information to develop a coherent and plausible story about what’s going on and why.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/F60219A5-C57F-409D-A4E1-41B8895DA160)
    * Adam Grant explains in his book, Originals,3 people have no trouble turning any information they receive into a coherent narrative, even when the information is random. People can’t help seeing signals, even in noise.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/3E2E8DE4-D319-4858-95B3-3E91B955252F)
    * we all run the risk to jump to conclusions and take action without questioning the implicit assumptions—or the emotions—that dictate the way we interpret events and information.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/57E7FF38-51C2-4DD9-93B5-979DAD1EBAD1)
    * The remedy is to think about problems more thoroughly, search for missing information, double-check every clue, weigh the pros and cons, and investigate all possible hypotheses[ >>](marginnote3app://note/CFBE1B30-15F3-4AD6-86EF-0A80A549C6E2)


### So, are you Othello or Hamlet? Are you more likely to think—and act—too fast, or to get mired in analysis paralysis? While jumping to conclusions and actions is a widespread fault in individuals, analysis paralysis is frequent in large, bureaucratic organizations that pile up studies and reports before taking any action or no action at all.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/22384922-4CAA-4BD4-9766-6E32292D1A1F)



* On the one hand, being fast or lazy in our thinking allows us to economize on scarce and expensive mental resources, but the resulting solutions are often poor and ineffective.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/934F7C4C-595B-48F5-A351-5A11DED1F6A2)
* On the other hand, slow thinking and thorough investigation are necessary to tackle complex business problems—the focus of this book—but the reflection process might create delays in decision-making and thwart action.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/0F0F6A61-C340-4D27-9BC1-3B3057EC3F68)
* For organizations and institutions to be both effective and efficient, they need people who can overcome these challenges to solving complex business problems[ >>](marginnote3app://note/9B132329-3BD8-47FE-9875-72CA3AADDB3C)
    * Conventional wisdom suggests these people should be chosen for their intelligence, experience, and expertise. But as we’ll see, being smart, experienced, and well-trained may not be enough. A systematic problem- solving method is also necessary.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/8566EF68-D56A-4EE1-899B-62E9E3ECAA58)
2. **Problem Solving and the Expertise Trap[ >>](marginnote3app://note/39A9F30C-32D7-4AFA-8BC7-C5D705708711)**
            1. Experts have developed in-depth knowledge within a particular domain through extensive study and practice, and have mentally organized their knowledge for easy recall and use.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/6FAC87B0-77D6-46CF-BB27-B629C85CCA22)
                1. Within their domain of expertise, experts have advantages over novices: they have more richly developed mental models of different problems and can better recognize and understand problems, often by using analogies to past problems[ >>](marginnote3app://note/A03C8225-D3A2-417B-9B78-959178B6B672)
                    1. While analogical reasoning can be a valuable source of insight and creativity, it can lead to poor solutions when problem solvers develop analogies based on superficial similarities instead of deep causal traits. When problem solvers have deep experience in a particular domain, their knowledge is salient and easy to recall, which can lead them to pay more attention to characteristics of the new setting that seem similar and ignore those that are different, and to develop superficial analogies and poor solutions. Experience can be a poor guide when working outside your area of expertise or when the nature of your work changes.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/32C01F7E-579B-46E7-B24A-AB1405843CC6)
                        1. Reasoning by analogy can also lead experts to develop poor solutions when faced with new but seemingly familiar situations[ >>](marginnote3app://note/CB1DACFE-E9C0-477D-854F-A7D01B031F1E)
                        1. When reasoning by analogy, a person starts with a new, unfamiliar target problem to solve. She then considers other source settings she knows well and compares them to the target through a process of similarity mapping.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/C50B14E6-AF94-40B1-AD32-428E5082B0E8)
                        1. By finding a source problem she believes has similar characteristics as the target, she identifies a candidate solution that solved or could have solved the source problem.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/657154F0-4634-4880-ACA3-9083BB8F5403)
                        1. The whole process may be summed up like this: “I’ve seen something like this before, so what worked there may work here.”[ >>](marginnote3app://note/38E490FB-B158-47E4-A906-7AB6CFC282CF)
                1. Experts also use more effective problem-solving strategies in their areas of expertise, more carefully evaluate potential solutions against constraints, and more effectively monitor their problem-solving progress by refining solutions[ >>](marginnote3app://note/12B6E761-ABB8-4E67-8704-E01231066586)
                1. Even though experts are better problem solvers than novices within their areas of expertise, when they tackle problems outside their expertise or when task conditions in their fields change, they often perform like novices … or worse[ >>](marginnote3app://note/39C9FA8C-E78D-4F29-A3C5-F094F51C36B8)
                    1. Experts’ rich and detailed mental models can constrain their ability to understand problems and search for solutions when working outside their fields of expertise. Mental models are rigid and resistant to change, particularly when associated with successful outcomes. Experts can become trapped by their expertise.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/64901E6D-50E8-4BE5-B437-F6DDBD8BBDC7)
                        1. the more expertise and experience people gain, the more entrenched they become in a particular way of viewing the world[ >>](marginnote3app://note/B1F44B66-E816-4016-B4E6-610CDC501D97)
                        1. Compared to novices, experts also are overconfident in their ability to understand problems outside their areas of expertise, leading them to develop worse solutions[ >>](marginnote3app://note/1E438B1B-0283-4CB0-B1AF-43F380A3BE45)
            1. Managers and consultants typically specialize in particular functional or industrial areas for much of their careers, developing expertise in these areas.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/FF47FB89-4055-4B79-BB6C-99FDC8F29485)
        1. Complex Problems and “Unknown Unknowns”[ >>](marginnote3app://note/58746FEF-3647-4888-9F5E-2B378F7A46E1)
            1. Many business problems are complex, ill-defined, and non-routine[ >>](marginnote3app://note/2E172DF7-422B-4ECB-9874-93A16063947A)
                1. Complex problems’ many interrelated causes make them difficult to understand[ >>](marginnote3app://note/D730F770-BCBA-4208-B9A6-861A8B9B7B9D)
                1. An ill-defined problem is one where the current situation, desired outcome, and path between the two are difficult to articulate. Complex problems are often initially ill-defined and typically non-routine[ >>](marginnote3app://note/172729EE-DE3B-4A2F-8506-17FCB5613628)
                1. A non-routine problem has idiosyncratic characteristics: we face them infrequently and lack the opportunity to develop experience and expertise in solving them[ >>](marginnote3app://note/039C15FF-63EE-47A1-B05C-6EF34525C30D)
                1. The complexity of business problems often requires the integration of various domains of knowledge, exceeding the expertise of all but the polymath problem solver[ >>](marginnote3app://note/51BF96D1-3D70-40C8-9C06-9730E3790A07)
            1. As problem complexity increases, solvers are more likely to face “unknown unknowns,” further challenging the value of expertise[ >>](marginnote3app://note/877DBB45-5573-40CC-B9F0-28D36DF376FE)
                1. Faced with complex problems, we rarely know the right questions to ask.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/67EA42F6-7D7B-44C3-B8D4-1CA5F5B16E35)
                1. The more we are unaware of the factors that produce a problem, the more likely we are to be surprised when events happen that cause our solution efforts to fail.[ >>](marginnote3app://note/B3561235-2DB4-4F3F-8407-CBD485BF66EB)
